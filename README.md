# NBA observations

Jupyter notebooks exploring aspects of the NBA.

The first looks at a suggestion of Jeff Van Gundy's to replace all free throws with a single free throw. The notebook FreeThrows contains my code, and the results are presented on [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5858ys/quantifying_records_with_jeff_van_gundys/).

The second quntifies how long teams spend in the bonus. The notebook BonusTime contains my code and the results are on r/nba as [well](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5bnc6i/time_spent_in_the_bonus_oc/).
