# NBA observations

Jupyter notebooks exploring aspects of the NBA.

The first looks at a suggestion of Jeff Van Gundy's to replace all free throws with a single free throw. The notebook FreeThrows contains my code, and the results are presented on [r/nba](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5858ys/quantifying_records_with_jeff_van_gundys/).

The second quntifies how long teams spend in the bonus and is in progress.
